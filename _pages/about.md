About Me
=====
---
I'm a third year Ph.D. student at the Virginia Tech and a member of [Society + AI & Language (SAIL) Lab](https://sail.cs.vt.edu/) I where work with [Dr. Eugenia Rho](https://eugeniarho.com/).  
My research lies at the intersection of *Natural Language Processing*, *Human-Computer Interaction*, and *Computational Social Science* to explore how technology shapes our experiences and how it can be designed to better align with the ways we think and interact with the world around us.
